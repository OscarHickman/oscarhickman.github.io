Hey! I'm Oscar Hickman — a cosmology researcher applying machine learning to understand the large-scale structure of the Universe.

Currently based at Durham University (Institute for Computational Cosmology). Previously a quantitative developer; now focused on extracting physical insight from simulations and survey data using modern ML (graph networks, simulation-based inference, generative models). Interested in connecting statistical rigor with astrophysical interpretability.

Outside research: mediocre triathlete, Cuban salsa dancer, and occasional sailor. These keep me honest about time management and energy.

This site will grow as I add: publications, talks, project summaries, and exploratory notes on ML for cosmology. Early days — placeholders are here so future updates are easy.

If you're working on ML for cosmology, simulation-based inference, or differentiable physics and want to chat/collaborate, feel free to reach out at `oscar.hickman17@alumni.imperial.ac.uk`
